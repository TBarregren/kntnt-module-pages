# Kntnt Plugin

WordPress plugin that does nothing but keeps the most up-to-date version of typically building blocks of a plugin by Kntnt.

## Description

This is the most challenging section of every `README.md` file. What to tell. Well, the purpose is to give a more detailed description of the plugin.

The purpose of this particular plugin – Kntnt Plugin – is just to keep the most up-to-date version of typically building blocks of a plugin made by Kntnt. The plugin probably doesn't even work! In fact, if you install it and activate it, your site will probably just die. Truth to be told, it has never been tested. It is just a dummy.

## Installation

[Download latest version](https://github.com/Kntnt/kntnt-plugin/releases/latest) to your computer, and [upload it to WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-upload-via-wordpress-admin).

You can also install it with [*GitHub Updater*](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater), which gives you the additional benefit of keeping the plugin up to date the usual way. Please see its [wiki](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/wiki) for more information.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are the settings?

Look for `Kntnt Plugin` in the Settings menu.

### How do I know if there is a new version?

If you prefer WordPress to nag you about an update and let you update from within its administrative interface (i.e. the usual way), you must [download *GitHub Updater*](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/releases/latest) to your computer and [upload it to WordPress and activate it](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/wiki/Installation#upload).
